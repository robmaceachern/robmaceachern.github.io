<p>I've been working on a project that will hopefully make developing app using Core Data a little bit simpler. It's called <a href="http://robmaceachern.github.io/RMCoreDataStack/">RMCoreDataStack</a>. Give it a try if you're looking to integrate Core Data into your own iOS app. It should work on OSX too once I figure out how to properly setup the Cocoapod spec. Let me know if you end up using it in any of your own projects, I'd love to hear about it.</p>
